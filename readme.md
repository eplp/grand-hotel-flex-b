## Problems solved

* Use of the fontawesome.com, fonts.googleapis.com, and fonts.gstatic.com font families.
* Building the html code first using the Emmet tool. 
* Effective identification of needed containers to implement flexbox.
* Use of standard decimal font-size to facilitate use of rem units.
* Critical CSS properties used in this project:
   
   
   * align-items:
   * animation: enables an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
   * backface-visibility:
   * border-radius:
   * box-shadow:
   * cursor: pointer
   * display: flex 
   * flex-direction:
   * font-synthesis-small-caps: lets you specify whether or not the browser may synthesize small-caps typeface when it is missing in a font family. Small-caps glyphs typically use the form of uppercase letters but are reduced to the size of lowercase letters.
   * justify-content:
   * letter-spacing:
   * linear-gradient: creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
   * opacity:
   * position: fixed/relative/absolute
   * rem - Use sizes related to rem (root em) - unit of measurement that represents the font size of the root element.
   * text-transform:
   * transform: enables you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual. 
   * transition: allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
   * z-index:  sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex and grid items.
